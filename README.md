# Today - News for everyone

We are your source for the latest news, delivering the most up-to-date stories from around the world. Our dedicated team of journalists is committed to providing you with accurate and reliable news coverage.

Just Kidding! This is a fun side project of [Kashan](https://github.com/oikashan), built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The news articles are real—they're coming from [NewsAPI](https://www.newsapi.org)—but the rest of the site is just a dummy.

You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/oikashan/today-news).
Contributions are welcome!
